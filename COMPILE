Compiling Mudlet
-----------------

On Windows:
-----------
Use the Qt-4.6-SDK package from 
ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qtsdk/ or http://qt.nokia.com 
It comes with a binary distribution of the libs a ready made compiler (mingw)  
DEPENDENCIES: 
- Qt >=4.4 (included in the SDK)
- liblua-5.1 
- libpcre-7.8

Good Luck.


GNU/Linux:
----------
Mudlet is developed on GNU/Linux (Debian Sid) 

1. REQUIREMENTS:
 * lib >= Qt4.4 *development package* + development tools 
   (these usually ship in two different packages. If all fails download the sources of Qt4.5 or higher
   from www.trolltech.com and compile them (very easy, but takes up to 90 minutes)
 * libpcre-7.8 (lesser versions will work though)
 * lua version 5.1 or higher
   Ubuntu users can do: sudo apt-get install build-essential libqscintilla2-dev lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev qt4-dev-tools
   Others, see your distribution details for the said packages.

2. COMPILING:
=============
   There are two ways to compile Mudlet.

1. The simplest: after having untared the source (tar xzvf mudlet-HEAD.tar.gz)
   cd mudlet
   cmake .
   make
   make install
   The binary can be found in mudlet/src/mudlet

2. Our cmake build doesn't work on all systems yet. So if you have problems you can use the
   manual way with qmake. You can adjust the paths to the dependencies in the project file
   mudlet/src/src.pro - simply look at the top of the file and adjust the paths you find to
   your own system. This is easy. If compile breaks with an error your paths are not correct.
   After having adjusted src.pro:
   make clean 
   qmake-qt4 (NOTE: On most systems there is qmake and qmake-qt4 qmake relates to the old qt version 3 qmake.)
   make
   make install

   The binary can be found in mudlet/src/mudlet

   Note: If you run into compiler problems then look at the file mudlet/src/src.pro and 
   change the INCLUDE and/or LIBS part of the make file and set the correct path to the 
   qscintilla2 include dir "Qsci" correctly. Note that each line in this file needs to end with a "\"
